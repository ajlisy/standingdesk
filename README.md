Standing desk from single 4x8 sheet of plywood

Basic instructions:
- Open with Sketchup View or Sketchup Web (free at www.sketchup.com)
- Build with cabinet grade 3/4" plywood (I used birch)
- Desktop is 2 pieces -- glue them together on the face with Titebond 3 wood glue. Clamp all around
- All other pieces cut as dimensioned
- Use 50mm or 60mm decorative hex bolts (https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Find-Fastener-014973154233-Connector/dp/B003QKYSDG/ with nylon nuts to secure legs
- Sand with 120 grit and then 220 grit
- Finish with spar urethane, 3 coats on desktop and 2-3 on legs. Sand with 220 in between.

Good luck!
